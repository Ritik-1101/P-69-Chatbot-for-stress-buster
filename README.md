# ChatBot For Stress Buster

This project is a simple chatbot built with Flask, leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo and NLTK's VADER sentiment analysis to provide supportive responses and coping strategies based on user sentiment.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat**: Users can chat with the bot, which provides responses generated by GPT-3.5-turbo.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: The user's messages are analyzed using VADER sentiment analysis to determine their sentiment.
- **Coping Strategies**: Based on the sentiment analysis, the bot offers tailored coping strategies.
- **Mood Tracking**: The bot tracks and displays the user's sentiment over time.
- **Feedback Collection**: Users can provide feedback on the bot's responses, which is stored in a SQLite database.
- **Immediate Help Resources**: A dedicated resources page provides quick access to important mental health resources.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ritik-1101/P-69-Chatbot-for-stress-buster
cd P-69-Chatbot-for-stress-buster
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated.

#### On macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### On Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Your OpenAI API Key

You'll need an OpenAI API key to use GPT-3.5-turbo. Replace `'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'` in `app.py` with your actual OpenAI API key:

```python
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'
```

Alternatively, you can set up your API key as an environment variable using a `.env` file with the following content:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### 5. Run the Application

Start the Flask application using:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.
